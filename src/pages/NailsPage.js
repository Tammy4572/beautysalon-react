        <p>For your nails to be healthy your diet should include a lot of fruits and raw vegetables so that they get the required vitamins, minerals and enzymes. Eat food that is rich in silicon like broccoli, fish and onions. Eat foods rich in biotins like whole grains. Drink plenty of water and other fruit juices. Food rich in zinc and vitamin B will strengthen your nails. Fresh carrot juice rich in calcium and phosphorous is perfect for strengthening nails. In addition remember the following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of vitamin A and calcium in your body causes dryness and brittleness.</li>
            <li>Lack of protein, folic acid and vitamin C causes hangnails.</li>
            <li>White bands across the nails are a result of protein deficiency.</li>
            <li>A lack of sufficient hydrochloric acid can cause splitting nails.</li>
            <li>Lack of vitamin B12 can lead to dryness, very rounded and curved ends and darkening of nails.</li>
            <li>Insufficient zinc can cause development of white spots on the nails.</li>
            <li>Cuts and cracks in the nails may indicate a need for more liquids.</li>
            <li>Red skin around your cuticles can be caused by poor metabolism of essential fatty acids.</li>
        </ul>
